# Intro
This is the API for the Cohort Analysis application. For more information view the project root's readme.

# To Do
- [ ] Better handle timezones. At the moment we just assume that the timezone is PST. Allow the user to pass that in.
- [ ] Add ESLint
- [ ] Add Babel (ES6, Ramda Plugin)
- [ ] Add tests for methods that touch the database
- [ ] Add more validations. What if the uploaded CSV doesn't match what we expect?
- [ ] Seeding the DB is slow. Maybe use Redis instead.
